# api_fetching_with_getx

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Don't copy this project as it uses source tree so it will not work by simply cloning repository.

This project consumes Makeup API from https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com. It is free to use. 

This Project is just for practice purposes. I do not Intend to use it as in production neither 
I am responsible for anyone uses it in production or vice versa.
